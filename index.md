      <h3>What we do</h3>
    </div>

    <p>
    	We build custom web scrapers to crawl and extract data from web pages. Results will be stored in csv/excel files, or databases. To be <b>accurate</b> and <b>flexible</b>, each web scraping requirement will need a scraper of its own, instead of using a generic software.

    </p>

    <div class="list_style_5 color_blue">
    	<h6>Typical web scraping requests:</h6>
        <ul>

            <li><i>Build product intelligence system</i>: to setup a system that will scrape product data from websites and deliver results to you daily/weekly basis.</li>
            <li><i>Build a web scraping tool</i>: to create a web scraping tool so that you can use it yourself, on-demand.</li>
